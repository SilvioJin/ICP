# ICP
Iterative Closest Point algorithm - Acquisition and processing of 3D Geometry

This repo contains the work from the first project of the Acquisition and Processing of 3D Geometry 2018-2019 (UCL MSc CGVI).

The project computes the ICP algorithm to achieve alignment.

For details see : 3DGeometry_CW1.pdf
